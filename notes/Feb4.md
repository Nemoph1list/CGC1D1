# February 4	“What is Geography and 4Ws”



## What is Geography

- Geography is the science of understanding places and spaces.

  - This science examines the Earth’s surface and the processes that shape it.
  - Geography especially looks at the relationship between people and the Earth’s physical environment.
  - To understand our relationship with the Earth, geographers ask questions and search for answers to problems. By exploring these problems, we can make better, wiser decisions.



## Relationship Between Us and Our Geography

- How Geography Shapes Us

  - Influences where we live
  - We settle where there's natural resources/jobs
  - We settle in warmer climates    i.e. along the southern border in Canada

- How We Shape Our Geography

  - Influence the natural resources around us
  - change the land we live on
  - Preserve our natural resources

    

##  The 4W's

- What is where?

  - Location, features of the Earth, natural features, etc.

- Why there?

  - Causes	i.e. erosion, trade, climate factors
  - Processes    i.e. weathering
  - Interrelationships    i.e. water, people and animals

- Why care?

  - Importance, implications

- What to do?

  - Planning, decision-making



## Geography Thinking Concepts

Four concepts we use to think and learn about geography!
- Spatial Significance
  - A sense of space and place
  - Everything has a location
  - What makes one more important than another?
  - Make connections between location and physical characteristics

- Patterns and Trends

  - Pattern - characteristics/data that repeat themselves in environment    i.e. housing along a waterway
  - Trend - characteristics that are consistent in a particular setting over a period of time    i.e. temperature is rising
  - Helps us plan and develop solutions to predicted problems

- Interrelationships

  This helps us understand the reasons behind actions we take.    i.e. planning for a disaster (hurricane)

  - How the environment affects humans
  - How humans affect the environment

- Geographic Perspective
  - Issues can be seen from different perspectives (How we look at something)
  - SEEP
    - Social
    - Environment
    - Economic
    - Political



## What are some Issues in Canadian Geography?

- Interactions with the Physical Environment
- Managing Canada’s Resources and Industries
- Changing Populations
- Livable Communities



## What is the Inquiry Process?

- Formulate a question
- Gather & Organize
- Interpret & Analyze
- Evaluate & Draw Conclusions
- Communicate your Findings
