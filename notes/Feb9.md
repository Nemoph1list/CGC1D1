# Feb 9 "Map skills"



## Geography's Basic Tools

### 1. What is a Map?

> Definition: When the features of a globe are transferred onto a flat surface.

- The globe is in 3D and a flat surface is in 2D
- All maps are created by projecting the 3D globe onto a 2D surface.
- Therefore all 2D maps have some "distortion".



### 2. Map Projections

> There are many types of map projections that try to deal   with distortion. A 2D map can never eliminate ALL of the distortion. 



A cartographer selects a map projection depending on which properties of the earth are to be kept in the flat map:

1. Direction
2. Area
3. Shape
4. Distance



- Mercator Projection
  
    - Gives true direction
    - Used for navigation charts
    
    
    
- Lambert Conformal Conic
  
    - Tries to preserve area
    - Used to map small regions
    
    
    
- Robinson Projection
  
    - Tries to preserve shape
    - Distorts water to make the shape of the land accurate
    
    
    
- Pacific-centred World Map

    

- Polar View of World

    

- Sinusoidal Equal Area Projection
  
    - Tries to preserve distance
    - Serious distortion of shape
    - Good for Africa and South America
    
    
    
- Goode's Projection
  
    - Distortion of each land area is minimized
    - Used to show world patterns
    
    
    
- Peters (?)
  
    - Only map that shows the true area of each continent
    - Distort distances east to west



### 3. Map Types

> We need different types of maps to portray different information.



The four most common types are:

1. General Purpose Maps
    - Alphanumeric Map: uses letters and numbers to locate places
2. Thematic Maps
    - World Map by Population
3. Topographic Maps
    - Contour Lines
4. Digital Maps
    - Google Maps



### 4. How do we read maps?

> We can use grid systems to locate places on a map.

1. Latitude and Longitude
    - Grid work of lines extending north-south and east-west.
    - Measured as angles.
    - Latitude is measured north and south of the equator.
    - Longitude is measured east and west from the prime meridian.

2. Military Grid
    - A grid of blue lines on a map (eastings and northings) is used to identify squares in a grid pattern.
    - This grid system is used mainly on topographic maps.

> Why was the military grid system introduced?
- It was easier to place a grid system on a map then to use degrees, minutes and seconds from a globe.
- With the increasing range in artillery in WWI, latitude and longitude was too cumbersome.

> Reading a Military Grid
> Easting: Vertical line running from top to bottom on a topographic map
> Northing: horizontal line running across the topographic map.
> By combining the digits from the easting and from the northing, we are able to identify a point on the map.

3. Alphanumeric Grid
    - This system uses letters and numbers to identify squares in a grid pattern.
    - This grid system is used mainly on Road Maps.

> Reading an Alphanumeric Grid
> The letters represent the horizontal lines.
> The numbers represent the lines running from the top to the bottom of the map.

The Alphanumeric Grid is not as accurate as the Military Grid or Latitude and Longitude.



### 5. Scale

Three ways to show scale:

1. Linear Scale

2. Ratio or Representative Fraction 
   1:10000000

3. Statement
   One cm on the map is equal to 100 Km in real life.



- A map with a scale of 1:17500000 shows the entire earth as if you are high up in space. Since things appear small on this map, this type of scale is called a "small-scale".
- As You approach the earth and get closer, you can see more things in detail(things get larger). This type of scale is called a "large scale". An example would be 1:500.



### 6. Map Skills

- Essential Features of a Map
    - Title
    - Legend
    - Scale
    - Direction: compass or lat./log.
    - Date of publication
    - Border
