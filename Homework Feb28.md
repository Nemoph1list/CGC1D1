# Chapter 3: How will climate change affect Canada?

> Describe the effects of Climate Change on the different regions of Canada. What is the most affected region according to this information?

- Atlantic Canada

  Canada's Maritime provinces will experience more storm events, increasing storm intensity, rising sea levels, storm surges, coastal erosion, and flooding as a result of a warming of global temperatures. Coastal communities are most vulnerable to these effects. Climate change will have also negatively affect industries such as fishing and tourism.

  

- Central Canada

  Central Canada will experience increased health risks as a result of global warming. The densely populated areas of southern Ontario and Quebec will experience increased risk of illness and premature death from climate-related events such as heat waves, increased smog and environmental changes that support the spread of vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.

  

- Prairies

  Changes in precipitation patterns will dramatically affect agriculture in the region. Recent trends and future projections show lower summer stream flows, falling lake levels, retreating glaciers, and reduced amounts of soil and surface water. As well, agricultural production and farm incomes could be at risk from extreme weather events such as tornadoes and hail, and the increasingly frequent presence of agricultural pests and diseases.

  

- Western Canada

  The increasing frequency of forest fires, storm surges, coastal erosion, landslides, hail storms, blizzards, droughts, and floods could have devastating effects on critical industries in British Columbia. The northern migration of the mountain pine beetle and record-setting forest fires have already had adverse effects on the forestry and tourism industries. Fisheries are also expected to be drastically affected by rising sea levels, higher freshwater temperatures, and changes in the volume, timing, and temperature of river flows.

  

- Canada's North

  Changes in temperatures are already having devastating effects on the ecological, economic, and human systems in northern regions. Sea ice, glaciers, and icecaps are melting and affecting northern waters, forests, plants, and animals. Communities that rely on these resources are being forced to adapt. Even a slight shift in temperature could potentially result in an ice-free Arctic in the next few decades.
